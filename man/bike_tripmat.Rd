\title{Extract station-to-station trip matrix or data.frame from SQLite3 database}
\usage{
bike_tripmat(
  bikedb,
  city,
  start_date,
  end_date,
  start_time,
  end_time,
  weekday,
  member,
  birth_year,
  gender,
  standardise = FALSE,
  long = FALSE,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bikedb}{A string containing the path to the SQLite3 database.
If no directory specified, it is presumed to be in \code{tempdir()}.}

\item{city}{City for which tripmat is to be aggregated}

\item{start_date}{If given (as year, month, day) , extract only those records
from and including this date}

\item{end_date}{If given (as year, month, day), extract only those records to
and including this date}

\item{start_time}{If given, extract only those records starting from and
including this time of each day}

\item{end_time}{If given, extract only those records ending at and including
this time of each day}

\item{weekday}{If given, extract only those records including the nominated
weekdays. This can be a vector of numeric, starting with Sunday=1, or
unambiguous characters, so "sa" and "tu" for Saturday and Tuesday.}

\item{member}{If given, extract only trips by registered members
(\code{member = 1} or \code{TRUE}) or not (\code{member = 0} or
\code{FALSE}).}

\item{birth_year}{If given, extract only trips by registered members whose
declared birth years equal or lie within the specified value or values.}

\item{gender}{If given, extract only records for trips by registered
users declaring the specified genders (\code{f/m/.} or \code{2/1/0}).}

\item{standardise}{If TRUE, numbers of trips are standardised to the
operating durations of each stations, so trip numbers are increased for
stations that have only operated a short time, and vice versa.}

\item{long}{If FALSE, a square tripmat of (num-stations, num_stations) is
returned; if TRUE, a long-format matrix of (stn-from, stn-to, ntrips) is
returned.}

\item{quiet}{If FALSE, progress is displayed on screen}
}
\value{
If \code{long = FALSE}, a square matrix of numbers of trips between
each station, otherwise a long-form \pkg{tibble} with three columns of of
(\code{start_station_id, end_station_id, numtrips}).
}
\description{
Extract station-to-station trip matrix or data.frame from SQLite3 database
}
\note{
The \code{city} parameter should be given for databases containing data
from multiple cities, otherwise most of the resultant trip matrix is likely
to be empty.  Both dates and times may be given either in numeric or
character format, with arbitrary (or no) delimiters between fields. Single
numeric times are interpreted as hours, with 24 interpreted as day's end at
23:59:59.

If \code{standardise = TRUE}, the trip matrix will have the same number
of trips, but they will be re-distributed as described, with more recent
stations having more trips than older stations. Trip number are also
non-integer in this case, whereas they are always integer-valued for
\code{standardise = FALSE}.
